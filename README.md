## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to increase my understanding of JavaScript in the browser.
It will implement:

- Basic storing of state
- More advanced manipulation of DOM elements
- More complex JavaScript and user interactivity

## Learning Objectives

For me the main objective is learning more about browser interactivity.
A lot of the basic state JavaScript is stuff I have encountered in previous work.
